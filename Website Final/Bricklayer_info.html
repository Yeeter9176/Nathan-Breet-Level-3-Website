          </p>
          <h3>Wages/Salary:</h3>
            <p>In New Zealand, Bricklayers that have up to 5 years experience, could expect to earn anything between $20, to $25 per hour
              (it depends on your employer/the type of work you do)
              <br>
              If you more than 5 years of experience as a bricklayer, you could expect to earn anything between $25, to $60 per hour.

            <h3>Job opportunities:</h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to the demand for bricklayers in New Zealand, you would be happy to find that, according to CareersNz,
              the chances of you getting a job as a bricklayer are good, due to there being a shortage of trade occupations, such as
              electricians, carpenters, builders, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>Training length:</h3>
            <p>
              The amount of time required for you to gain the necessary qualifications would likely vary depending on where you are
              performing your training, but the average length of time it takes to gain a qualification is between 2 to 3 years.
