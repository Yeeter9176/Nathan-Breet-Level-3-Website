            Whilst the main category may be Plumbers, there are two other occupations that involve similar jobs. These are Drainlayers and gasfitters.
            Being a plumber means you mainly work with pipes and fixtures that supply or drain water.
            Being a gasfitter means you mainly work with pipes and fixtures that supply gas.
            Being a drainlayer means your work mainly involves installing pipes that get rid of waste.

            <h3>Job opportunities:</h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to the demand for these jobs in New Zealand, you would be happy to find that, according to CareersNz,
              the chances of you getting a job as either a Plumber, gasfitter or drainlayer are good, due to there being a shortage of trade occupations, such as
              electricians, carpenters, builders, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>Training length:</h3>
            <p>
              The amount of time required for you to gain the necessary qualifications would likely vary depending on where you are
              performing your training, but the average length of time it takes to gain a qualification is between 2 to 4 years.
            </p>
