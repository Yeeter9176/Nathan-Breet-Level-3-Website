          <p>
            Being an electrician means you test, repair, maintain electrical systems and equipment.
            You will also be expected to work on a wide variety of electronics, from basic houshold wiring,
            all the way to power lines (with the appropriate training, of course).
          </p>
          <h3>Wages/Salary:</h3>
            <p>In New Zealand, new electricians could expect to earn anything between $20, to $23 per hour
              (it depends on your employer/the type of work you do)
              <br>
              If you are a more experienced electrician, you could expect to earn anything between $24, to $45 per hour.
            </p>
            <h3>Job opportunities:</h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to the demand for electricians in New Zealand, you would be happy to find that, according to CareersNz,
              the chances of you getting a job as an electrician are good, due to there being a shortage of trade occupations, such as
              electricians, carpenters, builders, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>Training length:</h3>
            <p>
              The amount of time required for you to gain the necessary qualifications would likely vary depending on where you are
              performing your training, but the average length of time it takes to gain a qualification is between 3 to 4 years.
            </p>
